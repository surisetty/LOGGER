1) Done:Crate default config file with PES server details. So that user need not configure on first boot. This makes operator life simple 
2) Done:Create cron job to monitor application running status, if not running cron job to restart application. 
3) Done:Auto start application on boot eigther by cron job or service. 
4) Done:Application logs maintained at upto 5 backups for 1 MB size each 
5) Implement application initialization logic which will check config file COM ports, if any of the port is not working log the error in log file. 
6) Develop separate debug application with following features 
   When executed showd display user menu with following options. 
   ) Hardware test ---> test COM ports loopback test for selected port 
                   ---> MODBUS test take user input addr and display received data ( readbus and write bus) 
                   ---- ( If there is any utility is available use that) 
   ) Test network   ----> Ping gate way 
                    ----> Ping 8.8.8.8 
                    ----> FTP test send one sample file to ftp server 
                    ----> Read server configuration 
   ) Utility        ----> show available local data files. 
                    ----> show disk space. 
   ) application   ----->  Start application 
                   ----> stop applicaation 
                   ----->  show application PID 

7) Diagnostic class to be implemented to find and detect system health check . 
8) When application is starting log system uptime and application start time in log file. 
9) Print log file name on screen when appliation is starting.
