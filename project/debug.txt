) List available COM ports  :  Tyr to open COM ports and list all success ports. 
) Modbus loopback test : This should help in testing serial port. Entered charactor should be returned back. 
                          --- Inputs a) COMport 
                                     b) data byte (ascii or Hex) 
) LED test  : Blink all LEDs 5 times.
